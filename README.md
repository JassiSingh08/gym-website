## Technologies Used

The gym website project utilizes the following technologies:

- ReactJS: The frontend of the website is developed using ReactJS, providing a modern and interactive user interface.

- APIs: Two APIs are integrated into the project. One API is responsible for fetching exercise data and providing search functionality, while the other API fetches GIFs related to the exercises.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `src`: This directory contains the source code for the ReactJS application.
  - `components`: This directory contains reusable components used throughout the application, such as search bar, exercise card, video player, etc.
  - `pages`: This directory contains the main pages of the website, such as the home page, exercise details page, and similar exercises page.
  - `services`: This directory contains modules responsible for handling API requests and data fetching.
  - `utils`: This directory contains utility functions used across the application.
  - `App.js`: The main entry point of the application.
  - `index.js`: The file responsible for rendering the ReactJS application.

- `public`: This directory contains static assets, such as the website's favicon and the HTML template used as the base for the application.

- `README.md`: The readme file containing information about the project, its structure, and instructions for running the application.
